											<h1>About Me<br />

										</header>
										<p>I currently pursuing a Masters in Data Science and will be graduating in December 2022. Previously, I graduated from the University of Texas in Spring 2021 with a Bachelors in Business Administration. I decided to go to graduate school in a discipline that was drastically differnet from my undergraduate studies for a number of reasons. The first reason was that I wanted to gain a better understanding of statistics and data science. I strongly felt that statistics was a key tool to better answer empirical questions. Secondly, I wanted to explore a different field that was more research oriented. I was always interested in research but my undergraduate studies were mostly geared towards business. Finally, I wanted to gain the skills necessary to solve more complex problems. I felt that a Masters in Data Science would give me the skillset needed to tackle more difficult problems. My research interests include Bayesian methods and their applications to solving real-world problems, Natural Language Processing, and Information Retrieval. More specifically, I am interested in information extraction, relationship extraction, statistical semantics, distributional semantics, contradiction detection, and proposition extraction. I believe that NLP and IR are powerful tools that can be used to make significant contributions in many different areas. After completing my Masters, I hope to pursue a PhD so that I can gain a deeper understanding of the theory behind the practice and apply my skills to solve more complex problems. Pursuing a Ph.D. would also allow me to make significant contributions to my field and expand my knowledge. My future goals consist of diving deeper into my research interests, specifically in Natural Language Processing and Information Retrieval, and making significant contributions in these areas.</p>

												<h3>Robust, Individualized, and Structured Document Generation</h3>
												<p>My current project involves building a hierarchical document model that can effectively generate structured documents. This is in contrast to free-text generation models, such as the ones used by many Large Language Models, which often lack factual accuracy. My goal is to build a model that can aggregate large volumes of structured and unstructured information, such as webpages, papers, and user-created documents, and generate accurate and informative documents. The goal is to be able to individualize the document generation process so that each document is tailored to the specific needs of the user and is influenced primarily by the user's preferences as well as the content that is being aggregated, which should also be selected by the user. Essentially, the idea is to be able to individualize the models so that they are fine-tuned to each user, thereby providing more robust and accurate document generation outputs. The specific part of this project that I have been most interested in lately is the modeling of factual information and methods for better measuring the level of factuality of Transformer model generated output.</p>
